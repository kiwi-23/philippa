          <p class="help-content">Philippa has been trained on multiple moral dilemmas that pit 5 lives against 1. Even though the scenarios all bear the same consequences, our moral intuition will tell us that they are inherently different from one another. That is because there are more moral variables at play than just the number of lives.<br><br>
            A machine usually only understands arithmatic comparisions, 5 is greater than 1, yet Philippa works on a framework that accounts for other moral variables- desire, intent and duty. The framework looks like this-<br><br>
            action[(number),(desire),(intent),(duty)]<br><br>
            For example, for the first and second scenarios, it is one thing to steer towards someone foreseeing that you will kill him and another to aim at his death as part of your plan. There’s no certainty that the worker will die, it is possible that he may find a foothold in the tunnel to cling onto till the train passes. The driver does not jump out of the trolley to kill the worker. The surgeon, however, needs the death of the healthy man for his purposes.<br><br>
            This is the distinction between direct and oblique intent. As the trolley driver, you do not directly intend the person’s death, but as the transplant surgeon, the person’s death is necessary for you to save the five patients.<br><br>
            For a detailed reading on the other variables, here is the <a href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/go7kfmc408d4tfi/Philippa%20-%20Research%20Paper.pdf?dl=0">full research paper</a>.

          <p>Philippa is a neural network that is capable of measuring the morality of an action through logic, she makes ethical decisions by evaluating the worth of a person's life beyond a simple quantitative (5 > 1) comparison.</p>
